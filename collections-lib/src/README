This directory is intended for common specific library.
PlatformIO has a built-in Library Management where developers can declare project dependencies and PlatformIO will automatically manage them (install, build, update). It doesnâ€™t have any requirements for a library source code structure. The only requirement is a library manifest file - library.json, library.properties, or module.json. It must be located in the root of a library.

We recommend to use `src` folder for your C/C++ source files and `include` folder for your headers. You can also have nested sub-folders in `src` or `include`.

For example, see a structure of the following library `Foo`:

|--examples
|  |
|  |- sample.c
|--include
|  |
|  |- header.h
|--src
|  |
|  |- Foo.c
|  |- Foo.h
|- library.json (https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html)
